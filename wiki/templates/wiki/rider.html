            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Max Fredriksson grew up with a bike between his legs and has been jumping them for over 13 years to get
                to the head heights he now finds himself at. He has amassed a stack of peachy contest finishes and a top
                three world ranking since his 2011 debut on the international slopestyle scene, but a nasty injury in
                2017 and arm breaking bail in 2018 on the glory booter of the Crankworx NZ course put the brakes on his
                skyward trajectory.</p>

            <p>In Max’s words though, “it was nothing that a bit of hard work down the gym couldn’t cure,” and in 2019
                he came belting back, stacking up a season of banger edits and travel stories, as well as playing plenty
                of BIKE with his right-hand-man Theo – you can check out on their mind-bending trickery on their YouTube
                channel.</p>

            <p>With 2019 in the bag, which Max described as his “best year ever”, 2020 is looking like a humdinger,
                with Max promising to dial three crispy new tricks on the contest circuit – “to be shown when the time
                is right” says Max.</p>

            <p>Keep watching this space and his YouTube channel for his latest news and views, and fingers crossed Theo
                gets his tail whips down and wins a game of BIKE… </p>
