# RideFMB

A web page where you can easily access all information about FMB World Tour riders, events and rankings.

## Website

You can find it here: https://tymsoncyferki.eu.pythonanywhere.com

## Data

The timeliness and correctness of data is 90% dependant on official [FMB World Tour](https://www.fmbworldtour.com) website. However on my web page you will be able to also find riders age, personal description or points for the runs in particular events.

## Features

Why my website is (or will be) better than official one? 
- Mobile responsiveness
- Easy search for riders and events
- Multiple filter and sort options for browsing data
- More natural site navigation
- Better SEO (hopefully)
